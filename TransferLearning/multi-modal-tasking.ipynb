    "For this lab, a dataset containing some of the Pokemon collection was chosen. The idea is to perform a multi-task classification to predict what types of pokemon a particular sample has. In this case, our practice is completely related to a multi-task classification, where multiple heads of our model are in charge of identifying a particular type, and making binary classification from a single pokemon image. The dataset consists of images from multiple pokemons and a csv file containing the name and 2 types for each pokemon. There are 18 types of Pokemons in our dataset, as described in the next list:\n",
